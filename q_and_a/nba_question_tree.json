            "answer": "I queried the MCP NBA standings for the 2025 regular season (data as of Nov 23, 2025). The Eastern Conference / Atlantic and Southeast entries show season-per-game scoring averages and point differential per game (points_for, points_against, point_diff):\n\n- Miami Heat: points_for 124.81, points_against 119.00 → point_diff = +5.81\n- Philadelphia 76ers: points_for 118.40, points_against 116.13 → point_diff = +2.27\n\nNet rating (points per 100 possessions differential) = (points_for − points_against) / possessions * 100. In the early season (NBA 2025–26 began in late October), season-to-date numbers essentially reflect the 30-day window immediately before Nov 23, 2025 (Oct 24–Nov 22) because almost all games played in that span are the team’s season games to date. Miami’s season point differential per game (+5.81) is materially larger than Philadelphia’s (+2.27). For Philadelphia’s net rating to be higher than Miami’s despite a smaller per-game point differential, Philadelphia’s possessions per game (pace) would have to be far lower than Miami’s—less than ~39% of Miami’s pace (PD_ph / PD_mi = 2.27 / 5.81 ≈ 0.39). That is effectively impossible in real NBA data (team paces are typically similar and nowhere near that disparity).\n\nGiven the MCP standings data and the mathematical relationship between point differential, pace, and net rating, the evidence strongly supports that Philadelphia did NOT have a higher net rating than Miami in the 30 days immediately before Nov 23, 2025. Caveats: I used season-to-date per-game scoring differentials from the MCP standings as the proxy for the 30-day window; if you need an exact possessions-based net rating for that exact 30-day window, we would need team possessions/pace or team offensive/defensive rating splits for that window (those would confirm the same ordering).",

            "answer": "I attempted to retrieve official team splits/statistics from the MCP NBA server to get Philadelphia’s home record for the most recently completed regular season prior to Nov 23, 2025 (the 2024–25 regular season). The MCP seasonal statistics call returned an HTTP 404 error, so I could not fetch authoritative home-win totals from the provided server.\n\nBecause I could not access the MCP data as requested, I cannot cite direct evidence. For context, an NBA team plays 41 home games in a regular season, so “at least 60% of its home games” means at least 25 home wins (60% of 41 ≈ 24.6 → 25 wins). Historically, the Philadelphia 76ers have often been a top-tier Eastern Conference team with a solid home-court record in recent seasons, so a yes answer is plausible but not certain without the season-specific data. Given the inability to verify the exact 2024–25 home record from the MCP server, I am providing a probabilistic judgment rather than a data-backed confirmation.\n\nBecause MCP access failed, this probability reflects an informed estimate (not direct evidence) based on recent team strength and typical NBA home/road splits.\n\n(If you want a definitive answer, I can try again if you allow another MCP call or you can provide the team’s 2024–25 home record and I’ll compute the exact result.)",

    "answer": "Research: I queried the NBA MCP server (season_rankings for the 2025 regular season). The data shows Miami (Heat) is ranked 4th in the Eastern Conference while Philadelphia (76ers) is ranked 6th. That indicates Miami has a modestly better standing at this point in the season. Limitations: the rankings call does not include exact records, point differentials, home/away for the Nov 23 game, injury reports, recent form (last 5–10 games), head-to-head matchup history, or betting lines — all of which materially affect a single-game win probability. Reasoning/weighting: • Standings (MCP): Miami slightly stronger (favoring Miami). • Single-game variance: NBA single games are noisy — smaller standing differences often translate to modest edge (not overwhelming). • Home-court unknown: if Philadelphia is at home the probability increases by several percentage points; if away it decreases. • Missing information (injuries, rotations, betting market) could easily shift the estimate ±10–15 points. Given the available evidence (Miami ranked above Philadelphia but only one rank spot difference within the conference top 6), and absent lineup/home information, the most defensible estimate is that Philadelphia is a modest underdog for that matchup. I estimate the chance Philadelphia wins (i.e., the market resolves to Yes) at about 42%. This reflects the standings-based edge for Miami plus single-game variability and uncertainty from missing specifics. Recommendation: to improve confidence, fetch the Nov 23 schedule (to confirm home/away), team records and point differentials, recent form (last 5–10 games), injury reports, and bookmaker moneyline/favorites.",
